# Examples

The `ballerinax/slack` connector provides practical examples illustrating usage in various scenarios, covering use cases like cache management, session management, and rate limiting.

## Prerequisites

1. Generate Slack token to authenticate the connector as described in the [Setup guide](https://central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/slack/latest#prerequisites).

2. For each example, create a `Config.toml` file the related configuration. Here's an example of how your `Config.toml` file should look:

   ```toml
   token = "<token>"
   ```

## Running an Example

Execute the following commands to build an example from the source:

- To build an example:

  ```bash
  bal build
  ```

- To run an example:

  ```bash
  bal run
  ```

## Building the Examples with the Local Module

**Warning**: Due to the absence of support for reading local repositories for single Ballerina files, the Bala of the module is manually written to the central repository as a workaround. Consequently, the bash script may modify your local Ballerina repositories.

Execute the following commands to build all the examples against the changes you have made to the module locally:

- To build all the examples:

  ```bash
  ./build.sh build
  ```

- To run all the examples:

  ```bash
  ./build.sh run
  ```
