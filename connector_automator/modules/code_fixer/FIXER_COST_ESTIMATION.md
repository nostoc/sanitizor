# Anthropic API Cost Estimation: Ballerina AI Code Fixer

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a cost estimation for running the Ballerina AI Code Fixer application using Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4 API. The estimate is based on a projected usage of 1 daily active developer working on Ballerina projects.

The primary model considered for this estimation is Claude Sonnet 4 for intelligent code fixing and compilation error resolution.

Based on the assumptions outlined below, the estimated costs are:

**Estimated Daily Cost: $2.73**  
**Estimated Monthly Cost (30 days): $81.90**

These figures represent the operational costs for token processing during active development sessions with compilation error fixing.

## 2. Scope and Assumptions

This estimate is based on the following scope and a set of key assumptions about developer behavior and application architecture. Actual costs may vary depending on real-world usage.

**Application Type:** AI-Powered Ballerina Code Fixer  
**Daily Active Developers:** 5  
**Model:** Claude Sonnet 4 

| Metric | Assumed Value | Rationale |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Fix Requests per Developer/Day | 10 | Moderate usage during active development with compilation errors |
| Average Input Tokens per Request | 6,750 tokens | Includes file content, error context, and fix instructions |
| Average Output Tokens per Request | 6,500 tokens | Complete fixed file content  |
| Files with Errors per Session | 4 files | Common scenario for multi-file error fixing |
| Iterations per File | 2| Average including successful first attempts and retries |

## 3. Cost Calculation Breakdown

The total cost is based on input and output token processing with Claude Sonnet 4 for intelligent code fixing.

### 3.1. Generation Costs (Claude Sonnet 4)

This represents the complete cost structure for the AI code fixing service.

**Input Tokens**
- Model Price: $3.00 per 1M tokens
- Input Tokens per Request:
  - File Content: 6,000 tokens
  - Error Context: 500 tokens  
  - Fix Instructions: 150 tokens
  - **Total: 6750 tokens per request**
- Total Daily Requests: 1 developer × 10 requests/developer = 10 requests
- Total Daily Input Tokens: 20 requests × 6750 tokens/request = 135,000 tokens
- Calculation: (135,000 / 1,000,000) × $3.00
- **Estimated Daily Input Cost: $0.405**

**Output Tokens**
- Model Price: $15.00 per 1M tokens
- Output Tokens per Request: 6,500 tokens (complete fixed file)
- Total Daily Output Tokens: 10 requests × 6,500 tokens/request = 65,000 tokens  
- Calculation: (65,000 / 1,000,000) × $15.00
- **Estimated Daily Output Cost: $0.975**
