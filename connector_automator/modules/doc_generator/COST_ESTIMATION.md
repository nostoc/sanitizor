# Claude API Cost Estimation: Ballerina AI Document Generator

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a cost estimation for running the AI-Powered Document Generator. The estimate covers the end-to-end process of generating a full suite of documentation for a single Ballerina connector, including the main `README.md`, module-level documentation, test guides, and individual example walkthroughs.

The primary model used for this estimation is **Claude Sonnet 4**, which is responsible for analyzing connector source code and generating all Markdown content.

Based on the assumptions outlined below for an average-sized connector, the estimated costs are:

**Estimated Cost per Connector Generation: ~$0.70**

This figure represents the operational cost for token processing required to generate all documentation artifacts for one connector in a single run.

## 2. Scope and Assumptions

This estimate is based on the process of generating documentation for one average Ballerina connector. Actual costs may vary depending on the complexity of the connector, the size of its `types.bal` file, and the number of examples.

* **Application Type**: AI-Powered Ballerina Documentation Generator
* **Model**: Claude Sonnet 4
* **Pricing**:
    * **Input**: $3.00 per 1M tokens
    * **Output**: $15.00 per 1M tokens

| Metric | Assumed Value | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total AI Requests per Connector** | 12 | The `generate-all` command triggers generation for the main README, module README, tests, main examples page, and individual examples, resulting in approximately 12 distinct calls to the LLM. |
| **Average Input Tokens (Large Prompts)** | 52,000 tokens | Prompts for generating the `Quickstart` sections are large because they include the entire content of `client.bal` and `types.bal` for in-depth analysis by the AI. |
| **Average Input Tokens (Small Prompts)** | 2,000 tokens | Prompts for sections like `Overview`, `Setup`, and `Tests` are smaller, as they rely on summarized metadata rather than full source code. |
| **Average Output Tokens per Request** | 1,500 tokens | Each request generates a complete, formatted Markdown section for a README file, including code blocks and detailed text. |
| **Examples per Connector** | 2 | Assumes an average connector has two distinct examples, each requiring its own individually generated README file. |

## 3. Cost Calculation Breakdown

The total cost is calculated based on a mix of large and small AI requests required to generate all documentation for a single connector.

### 3.1. Generation Costs (Claude Sonnet 4)

This represents the cost for generating all documentation content, from the overview to individual example guides.

#### Input Tokens

* **Large Prompts (e.g., Quickstart)**: 2 requests × 52,000 tokens/request = 104,000 tokens
* **Small/Medium Prompts (other sections)**: 10 requests × 2,000 tokens/request = 20,000 tokens
* **Total Input Tokens**: 104,000 + 20,000 = **124,000 tokens**
* **Calculation**: (124,000 / 1,000,000) × $3.00
* **Estimated Input Cost**: **$0.372**

#### Output Tokens

* **Total Output Tokens**: 12 requests × 1,500 tokens/request = **18,000 tokens**
* **Calculation**: (18,000 / 1,000,000) × $15.00
* **Estimated Output Cost**: **$0.27**
